Intelligent Assistant — Prompt Engineering, API Integration &
Hallucination Management
Project Overview
The aim of this assignment is to design and implement a conversational assistant that leverages a Large
Language Model (LLM) to deliver coherent, engaging, and context-aware interactions. The assistant’s
domain and purpose are entirely up to you (e.g., productivity, tutoring, information lookup, entertainment,
sports, etc.). A core requirement is the enrichment of responses through seamless integration with at
least two external APIs.
Core Requirements
Conversation-Oriented Design
● Assistant Purpose:
Design an assistant in any domain of your choice. It should handle at least three different types of
queries or tasks relevant to its intended purpose.
● Context & Continuity:
The assistant must track and manage conversational context, including follow-up and clarifying
questions, for natural multi-turn interactions.
● Interaction Flow:
Ensure conversation feels natural and user-friendly, prioritizing clarity, helpfulness, and accuracy
in each exchange.
Advanced Prompt Engineering
● Prompt Crafting:
Demonstrate thoughtful prompt design to elicit accurate, concise, and context-relevant answers
from the LLM.
● Multi-Step Reasoning:
Include at least one prompt or structured method that guides the LLM through a chain-of-thought
process.
● Control Strategies:
Implement prompt techniques or instructions that help reduce the likelihood of hallucinations or
off-topic responses.
Technical Implementation
● Programming Language:
Free choice of language.
● LLM Model:
Integrate with any LLM API or mode
● Interface:
A CLI is required; a web UI is optional but encouraged for enhanced usability.

External Data Integration
● API Connections:
The assistant must use at least two external APIs (your choice).
● Data Fusion:
Carefully combine external API data with LLM knowledge in your responses, ensuring the data
presented is accurate and reliable.
● Decision Logic:
Develop a clear strategy for deciding when to use external data versus relying on the LLM,
prioritizing accuracy and minimizing hallucinations

Hallucination Detection & Management
● Include methods or heuristics to detect potential hallucinations and misinformation in the
assistant’s responses.
Evaluation Criteria
1. Conversation Quality:
Are interactions helpful, logical, accurate, and engaging?
2. Hallucination Handling:
How well does the system detect, mitigate, and recover from hallucinations or LLM mistakes? Is
the approach robust and user-friendly?
3. Context Management:
Is conversational history followed and context maintained throughout multi-turn exchanges?
4. External Data Integration:
Are your chosen APIs meaningfully and accurately blended with LLM outputs?
Submission Guidelines
● Source Code:
Submit all code on GitHub.
● Conversation Transcripts:
Provide sample transcripts/screen captures that demonstrate system functionality.
Additional Notes
This assignment is above all a demonstration of your ability to design effective, reliable, and trustworthy
LLM-powered conversational systems. Highlight not only your technical skills but also your judgment in
managing the limitations and risks of generative models. Prioritize creativity, conversation quality, user
trust, and clarity.
